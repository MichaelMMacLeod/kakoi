# impose structure by surrounding alike things #

[kakoi](kakoi.html) allows the grouping of alike things. A single interpretation
of a piece of data may be placed in any number of---possibly
overlapping---groups. Groups themselves are treated as pieces of information
that can be placed in further groups.

By default, [kakoi](kakoi.html) imposes no rules on what may be placed within a
group. If several things appear to share a certain quality, group them!
